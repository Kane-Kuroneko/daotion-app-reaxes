  "A definite protocol encodes the social trust relationship of Web3 by extracting the non-transferable, non-financial token attributes of SoulBound Tokens (SBTs), rather than the highly financial token attributes such as ERC20 and ERC721. The token is the great innovation of the blockchain, but if it exists solely as a financial asset attribute, it will lose other advantages of the token. Here we propose a protocol using SBTs synthesis to solve trust coding, which encapsulates the reputation data point of each organization participant through the generation of SBTs, the data points either come from the fungible and non-fungible tokens or the on-chain contract interaction data of external accounts and the trusted data of the off-chain centralized society. The data availability of each data point is determined through smart contracts and Hash Algorithm. Second, just like the proof-of-work chain of Bitcoin, a data point chain with an inheritance relationship is formed through the synthesis of SBTs to dynamically maintain the interactive relationship between social organizations and individuals. The increase of synthesis will continuously build a reliable ladder to a decentralized society. Finally, the attribution analysis of those SBTs data point chains is not only a variety of morphological evidence of the witnessed data series but also a reliable organizational development and governance path of DAOs. The optimal strategy through attribution analysis is the development and governance strategy with the highest degree of consensus, which is the collection of Web3 souls that decentralized social organizations should look for.": "一个协议通过提取灵魂绑定通证(SBTs)不可转让性、非金融化的代币属性，而不是ERC20、ERC721等高度金融化代币属性，对Web3的社会信任关系进行编码。代币是区块链的伟大创新，但如果代币仅仅作为一种金融资产属性存在，那就失去了代币所代表的其他优点。我们提出一种使用SBTs合成的方法来解决信任编码的协议方案。该协议首先通过SBTs的生成来封装每个组织参与者的声誉数据点，这些数据点可能来自于同质化和非同质化代币、外部账户的链上交互数据和链下中心化社会的可信数据，通过智能合约和哈希来确定每一个数据点的数据可用性。其次，就像比特币的工作量证明链一样，通过SBTs的合成来形成一条具有继承关系的数据点链条，对社会组织和个体的互动关系历程进行动态维护，合成的增加会不断建造通往去中心化社会的可信阶梯。最后，归因分析那些SBTs数据点链条不仅是被见证数据序列的多种形态证据，而且也是DAOs最可靠的组织发展和治理路径，通过归因分析得出的最优策略，是共识程度最高的发展和治理策略，而这正是去中心化社会组织所应该寻找的Web3灵魂集合。",
  "In the 1980s, Gartner Group proposed to develop the theory and practice of customer relationship management and was responsible for collecting all the information that customers contacted with the company. In 1999, the concept of customer relationship management (CRM) was further proposed, thus the concept of CRM appeared in the public's vision formally. Founded in 1999, Salesforce has begun to build its cloud CRM platform, which has become a benchmark in this field in the past two decades. From the early hard disk software to today's web software platform based on cloud computing, and the coming era of decentralized governance protocols, the core purpose of CRM lies in how to better manage the interaction process of organizations and individuals. Due to the paradigm shift of production relations in Web3, CRM needs to be redefined from a decentralized perspective today, we prefer to use stakeholder relationship management (SRM). Under the traditional corporate system, the goal is to maximize the interests of shareholders. Although user-centered in the development of the Internet has been started to advocate, the logic of the underlying value distribution remains unchanged at the core to maximize the interests of shareholders. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) aim at maximizing the interests of stakeholders. Supported by blockchain technology, including interaction, relationship, data, and value, the production relationship and value distribution take the smart contract as the technical carrier, which is stored in the blockchain trusted network and co-build the foundation of the SRM protocol.": "上世纪八十年代，Gartner Group提出发展客户关系管理理论和实践，负责收集客户与公司联系的所有信息，1999年其正式提出客户关系管理(CRM)概念，CRM概念正式出现在大众视野。Salesforce在1999年成立，开始建设它们的云CRM平台，过去二十年成为了这个领域的标杆。CRM软件从早期单机本地硬盘软件到今天基于云计算的互联网软件平台，以及未来将要进入的去中心化治理协议时代，其核心目的仍在于如何更好地对组织和个人的互动历程进行管理。由于Web3的生产关系发生范式转变，今天需要以去中心化的视角重新定义CRM，我们更愿意称之为利益相关者关系管理(SRM)。传统公司制下是以股东利益最大化为目标，虽然互联网发展过程当中我们开始提倡以用户为中心，但仍然未改变底层价值分配的逻辑依旧是以股东利益最大化为核心。去中心化自治组织(DAOs)是以利益相关者利益最大化为目标，生产关系和价值分配由区块链技术所支撑的智能合约为技术载体，包括互动、关系、数据和价值都存储于区块链可信网络当中，共同构建了SRM协议的基础。",
  "As everybody knows, the core of Ethereum is the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), which provides an executable standard container for the state transition function of the Ethereum network. The decentralized social relationship state transition requires a set of standards similar to EVM. We argue that the cornerstone of this standard is Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) jointly proposed by E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum smart contract is like an encrypted \"box\", which constantly receives messages and transactions from external accounts and changes the state of the entire network. We compare the SRM protocol to the Ethereum smart contract, constantly creating and synthesizing SBTs, while changing the relationship status between the organization and individuals. The SRM protocol can contribute to the construction of a decentralized society. DeSoc organizations can not only realize the identity, credentials, and attachments of SBTs representatives through the SRM protocol, but more importantly, they can manage the birth and growth of these souls in a decentralized manner, and find value growth points in line with their organizational characteristics from the data through the analysis of the decentralized data generated by the process.": "众所周知，以太坊网络的内核是以太坊虚拟机(EVM)，它为以太坊网络的状态转换函数提供一个可执行的标准容器，去中心化社会关系状态转换需要一套类似于EVM的标准，我们认为这个标准的基石就是E.Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin共同提出的灵魂绑定通证(SBTs)。以太坊智能合约就像是一个加密“盒子”，不断地接收来自外部账户的消息与交易，同时改变着整个网络的状态。我们将SRM协议类比成以太坊智能合约，不断地创建SBTs和不断地合成SBTs，同时改变着组织和成员的关系状态。SRM协议能够为构建去中心化社会添砖加瓦，去中心化社会组织通过SRM协议不仅仅可实现SBTs代表的身份、凭证和附属物，更重要的是它们可以去中心化地管理这些灵魂出生和成长的历程，并通过历程所产生的去中心化数据分析，从数据中找到符合自身组织特性的价值成长点。",
  "Stakeholder relationship management (SRM) is a management protocol for the interaction between DAO and existing and potential members. Through the historical accumulation and analysis of member data, SRM can dynamically manage the relationship between DAO and members, maximize the business growth of DAO and improve the retention of members, and maintain a high degree of consensus in the community.": "利益相关者关系管理（SRM）是一种DAO与现有成员及潜在成员之间关系互动的管理协议，通过对成员数据的历史积累与分析，SRM可以对DAO和成员之间的关系进行动态管理，从而最大化DAO的业务增长和提高成员留存，以及保持社区较高的共识程度。",
  "Firstly, the basic construction of SRM protocol requires a large amount of input data, including:": "首先，SRM协议基础性构建需要大量的输入数据，这些数据包括：",
  "Information on the purchase, holding, and sale of fungible/non-fungible tokens": "同质化/非同质化代币购买、持有和出售信息",
  "Messages and transactions of a function method call from external accounts to contract accounts": "外部账户对合约账户的函数方法调用的消息和交易",
  "Reputation and behavior credentials issued on/off the chain": "链上/链下所发行的声誉和行为凭证",
  "Information on/off the chain that can represent the user's identity": "链上/链下能够代表用户身份的信息",
  "The trusted data that can contribute SBTs generate": "以及有助于SBTs生成的可信数据",
  "The generation process of SBTs is a data cleaning process from unstructured data to structured data, which is not only for the basic classification and screening of SBTs but also for the use of data in more complex scenarios, such as AI machine learning. We claim that the input of data is very important. SBT represents the reputation data point of a user, which looks more like an organization that labels a member at different stages, such as when you have admitted the college, the authority will give you a student ID, and when you successfully graduate, a diploma is issued accordingly.": "一个个SBT的生成过程就是一次次非结构化数据转为结构化数据的数据清洗过程，这不仅仅是为了能够对SBTs进行基础分类和筛选，也是为了更复杂场景下的数据使用，比如人工智能机器学习。我们认为数据的输入是至关重要的，SBT所代表的正是一个用户的声誉数据点，这看起来更像是组织在给一个成员的不同阶段打上不同的标签，就好像当你刚走进大学校园的时候学校会给你一张学生证，当你顺利毕业走出大学校园的时候，学校会给你一张毕业证书。",
  "Secondly, different from CRM, SRM demands the establishment and maintenance of the relationship between the community and stakeholder members in the form of Web3.0 native DAO. CRM focuses to help traditional companies maximize the interests of shareholders from the tripartite game of shareholders, employees, and customers, while SRM is to help DAO maximize the interests of stakeholders from the trinity of \"shareholders\", \"employees\" and \"customers\". The transformation of this relationship is from one-way output centered on the company's market objectives to two-way interaction centered on the DAO governance rules.":  "其次，SRM协议诉求不同于CRM软件的是以Web3.0原生DAO形式的社区与利益相关者成员之间的关系为核心进行建立与维护，CRM是帮助传统公司从股东、员工、客户的三方博弈中实现股东利益最大化，而SRM是帮助DAO从“股东”、“员工”、“客户”的三位一体中实现利益相关者利益最大化。这种关系的转变是从公司市场目标为核心的单向输出到从DAO治理规则为核心的双向互动。",
  "The essence of CRM serving traditional company organizations is to conduct centralized hierarchical management more efficiently. Senior managers can conduct top-down management through permission settings. In particular, sales CRM can help sales supervisors track the sales performance of each sales team and each salesperson, and salesperson can also record and analyze the whole process of their customer management. Either from the perspective of shareholders, executives, and ordinary employees of the company, they all manage the customer status in one direction. The customers do not know what kind of status they are in the CRM of the company that serves them, which lies a great deal of information asymmetry. It is like when we go shopping, we always worry that the business will make customers pay more through information asymmetry. Because the SRM protocol serving DAOs operates on the blockchain network, the information is symmetric for all participants, and at least the organization and individuals can reach an agreement on the trust level. Now, the SRM protocol is for DAOs to better implement the bottom-up management mode. The changes in data points and data states are determined by the signatures of both organizations and individuals. All these signature matters and signature records are open, transparent, and traceable. With the transformation of paradigm, the logic of the underlying game changes from zero sum to positive sum, and the data state changes from one-way unilateral to two-way.": "服务于传统公司组织的CRM软件的本质是为了更加高效地进行中心化层级管理，高级管理人员可以通过权限的设置进行自上而下的管理，特别是销售型CRM能够帮助销售主管对于每一个销售小组及每一个销售员的销售业绩进行跟踪，同时销售人员也可对其客户管理进行全流程的记录和分析。无论从公司股东高管和普通员工角度出发，都是对客户状态进行单方向的管理，客户其实并不知道他们在这些服务他们的公司CRM里是一个什么样的状态，有着很大的信息不对称，这就好像我们去买东西的时候总是担心商家通过信息不对称导致我们东西买贵了。服务于DAOs的SRM协议因其运行在区块链网络之上，对所有的参与者来说信息都是对称的，至少组织与个人在信任层面上可以达成一致。而如今，SRM协议是为了DAOs能够更好地进行自下而上的管理模式，数据点及数据状态的改变都是由组织和个人双方共同的签名决定的，而所有的这些签名事项与签名记录都是公开、透明、可追溯的。随着范式的转换，底层博弈的逻辑从零和转向正和，数据状态从单向单方面转向双向双方面。",
  "Finally, it is not enough to imitate the CRM model and it cannot produce positive effects on decentralized governance. The design of the SRM protocol should conform to the characteristics of a decentralized network and can effectively meet the needs of DAOs in decentralized governance and community growth. Therefore, the author proposes a solution named SBT Fusion.": "最后，仅仅通过模仿CRM模式是不够的且无法对去中心化治理产生积极效用。SRM协议的设计应该符合去中心化网络的特性，并且能够切实解决DAOs在去中心化治理和社区增长方面的需求，所以我们提出的一种解决方案叫做SBT Fusion。",
  "When we talk about DID, one problem that needs to be considered is that behind an identity is the sum of a person's social experience and relationships, such as education, work experience, family, social activities, and interpersonal relationships. The application of DID in SRM protocol may be slightly limited. We do not seek to build a perfect DID protocol, however, it can effectively meet the needs of DAOs in development and governance to achieve one of the many roads to a decentralized society. The SRM protocol builds a decentralized identity system of encrypted native communities for DAOs through SBTs, instead of representing identity through financial attribute assets such as Token and NFT, or social account identity systems provided by Web2 centralized services. SBT Pad, SBT Fusion, SBT Datahub, and other modules will be provided to collect, generate and synthesize reputation data points, as well as analyze and utilize the data, to form a signed data status chain between the community and members.": "当我们谈论DID的时候，需要思考的一个问题是一个身份的背后是由一个人的社会经历和关系的总和组成，例如教育经历、工作经历、家庭经历、社交活动和人际关系等，SRM协议中对于DID的适用可能会稍显局限，我们并不追求构建一个完美的DID协议，但可以有效地满足DAOs在发展和治理方面的需求，我们力求实现通向去中心化社会多条道路中的一条。SRM协议通过SBTs为DAOs建设一套加密原生社区的去中心化身份体系，而不是通过Token、NFT等金融属性资产来代表身份，也不是通过Web2中心化服务提供的社交账户身份体系。我们将提供SBT Pad, SBT Fusion, SBT DataHub等模块，对声誉数据点进行采集、生成和合成以及数据分析利用，以形成社区与成员之间的双方签名数据状态链条。",
  "The SRM protocol is based on taking stakeholders as the center, driven by interactive connection, and dynamically connects potential community members with existing community members through the collection of data points and clues on and off the chain. The interactive information in the whole state chain will be recorded in the blockchain network, and then through the aggregation, precipitation, analysis, and utilization of data, the community will become more agile, assisting the community governance decision-making and business innovation, building the unique data assets of DAOs, and finally promoting DAOs to move towards decentralized and intelligent.": "SRM协议基于以利益相关者为中心，以互动型连接为驱动，通过链上和链下数据点线索采集为手段，将潜在社区成员与现有社区成员动态连接起来。整个状态链条中的互动信息将被记录在区块链网络当中，进而通过对数据的聚合、沉淀以及分析利用，使社区变得更加敏捷，辅助社区治理决策和业务创新，构建DAOs独一无二的数据资产，最终促使DAOs向去中心化智能化迈进。",

Poor economic models are certainly one of the factors, and insufficient guidance retention is also one of the factors.": "DAO的可持续发展基于留存用户的增长，即新加入的用户大于流失掉的用户。许多DeFi协议、PFP项目、GameFi社区在经历一段爆发式的增长之后，并未实现稳定的净增长曲线，随之带来的就是资产与代币的双死亡螺旋下跌，差的经济模型固然是因素之一，引导留存不足同样也是因素之一。",
  "The development strategy shown in the case in the figure is to guide community members to migrate from the existing SBT to the deeper SBT by creating the participation level of community members and forming the core community member group. When crossing different levels of SBT, we can continuously integrate different factors of SBT, which are highly related to community business, and we can conduct attribution analysis on retention and business.": "图中案例所示的发展策略通过打造社区成员的参与度阶梯等级，引导社区成员从已有等级的SBT通过合成往参与度更深等级的SBT，一级一级地进行迁移，形成社区核心成员群体。跨越不同等级的SBT时，可以不断融入不同因子的SBT，这与社区业务高度相关，可对留存与业务进行归因分析。",
  "The purpose of establishing the development strategy is to maximize the retention of members and build a community closed loop. There are various types of DAOs with great differences in development directions. It is necessary to use the development strategies in combination with the business characteristics of the community. SBT Fusion is a powerful configurable module that can create a retained growth curve of the community through interactive synthesis and non-interactive synthesis.": "设立发展策略的目的是为了成员留存最大化，构建社区闭环。DAOs的类型各式各样，发展方向差异较大，需要结合社区业务特点，对发展策略进行个性化使用，SBT Fusion是一个强大的可配置化的模块，通过交互式合成及非交互式合成的方式来打造社区的留存增长曲线。",
  "Decentralized governance is the cornerstone of building a decentralized social consensus layer, and community governance is also the cornerstone of building community consensus. The problem of excessive financialization and potential sybil attacks caused by governance tokens is depleting the innovation power of the community. For example, when small companies grow into large companies, the early exploration and research on products and technologies gradually become the technical means of how to better complete KPI.": "去中心化治理是构建去中心化社会共识层的基石，社区治理同样是构建社区共识的基石。治理代币造成过度金融化和潜在女巫攻击的问题，正在消耗社区的创新力，例如当小公司成长为大公司时，早期对于产品和技术的探索研究慢慢地变成了对如何更好地完成KPI的技巧手段。",
  "The governance strategy shown in the case in the figure hopes that DAOs can find a unique soul, further contribute to the governance of the community, and form a shared rights market. The unique soul SBTs synthesized by SBTs such as contribution participation and reputation accumulation, on the one hand, establishing a source of trust for the soul, on the other hand, building important roles and dynamic governance through trust coding, and form decentralized governance-related scores.": "图中案例所示的治理策略希望DAOs寻找到独特灵魂，并为社区的治理进一步贡献力量，形成共享的权利市场。通过贡献参与、声誉累计等SBTs合成的独特灵魂SBTs，一方面为灵魂建立了信任来源，另一方面用信任编码的方式建构重要角色和动态治理，并形成去中心化治理相关分数。",
  "The purpose of setting up the governance strategy is to build a multi-governance system through SBTs to ensure decentralization, ensure that the community can be trusted, and transform individual participants from \"not doing evil\" to \"cannot doing evil\". Then the community members will be driven by the financial returns and values, and build a bottom-up DAO with rich property and governance by stimulating the economy and consensus building.": "设立治理策略的目的是为了通过SBTs构建多元治理体系来确保去中心化，确保社区可以被信任，使个别参与者从“不作恶”转变成“不能作恶”。进而通过激励经济和共识建设，促使社区成员金融回报与价值观双层驱动，构建一个自下而上、财产与治理丰富的DAO。",
  "Strategy templates for leads collection, work proof, community building, community ambassador, authority management and governance efficiency, etc. We will work with DAOs to create more excellent strategies to help the development and governance of DAOs.": "线索采集、工作证明、社区建设、社区大使、权限管理、治理效率等策略模板，我们将会与DAOs一起创造更多优秀的策略，帮助DAOs的发展和治理。",

  "Improvement of issuance": "发行方式的完善",
  "Although the definition of issuer in the current protocol is relatively limited to the role of community administrator in DAOs, this is a person from the early core team in the decentralized community, and the power is relatively concentrated. We will improve the degree of decentralization of this module in the next version upgrade. Although we think that centralized startup is not a bad thing, because it can improve the efficiency of the startup stage, we will introduce a multi-sign mechanism, member issuance, group voting, and other functions to improve decentralized governance.": "虽然目前协议对于发行人的定义相对局限于DAOs中的社区管理员角色，这是一个在去中心化社区当中来自于早期核心团队的人员，相对来说权力比较集中，我们会在接下来的版本升级中提高这一模块的去中心化程度。虽然我们认为中心化启动并不是什么很糟糕的事情，因为它可以提高启动阶段的效率，但是我们后续会引入多签机制、成员发行、小组投票等功能来完善去中心化治理。",

  "The stakeholders of DAOs also include other DAOs. The interactive relationship between organizations also needs SBTs for fine operation and governance. It can even be understood that this is a kind of interoperability between contracts. The data relationship formed in the process will need to be analyzed and used to improve the interaction efficiency between organizations. For example, the community may need to uniformly coordinate the Safe vault administrators and operate multiple vault contracts, and the SBTs in this process can be used as authority credentials for unified management." : "DAOs的利益相关者同样也包含其他DAOs，组织与组织之间的互动关系同样也需要SBTs来进行精细化地运营和治理，甚至可以理解为这是一种合约之间的互操作性，过程中形成的数据关系就会有进行归因分析和使用的需求，以提高组织之间的互动效率。例如，社区可能需要对Safe金库管理员进行统一协调和多个金库合约进行操作，而这个过程SBTs可以作为权限凭证进行统一管理使用。",
  "Intelligent governance": "智能化治理",
  "After SBTs are applied on a large scale, they will form a large number of structured data sets, providing high-quality data sources for subsequent machine learning and deep learning. Decentralized governance will continuously increase the proportion of AI intervention, match the best strategies for DAOs and stakeholders, and improve the degree of automated governance. The abstracted soul address of the account can automatically interact with the matching SBTs issuer for the soul according to the set soul attribute, which will also improve the intelligent level of the SBTs-related ecology.": "SBTs被大规模应用后将构成大量结构化数据集，为后续的机器学习和深度学习提供了优质的数据来源，去中心化治理将不断提升人工智能介入的比例，为DAOs和利益相关者匹配最佳的策略，提高自动化治理程度。账户抽象化后的灵魂地址，可根据设定好的灵魂属性，为灵魂自动化地与匹配的SBTs发行人进行交互，这同样会带来SBTs相关生态的智能化水平的提升。",

We will continue to introduce the detailed design of token economics in the future. The plan that can be disclosed at present is to design free NFT to give issuers the supply related to the issuance, design SBTs to give holders the use related to holding and configure the balance between supply and demand of SBTs through the token supply consumption model to achieve positive feedback of the economic model.": "Daotion代币经济学的核心是为了SRM协议的资源配置效率最大化，协调SBTs的供给与需求关系，同时凝聚Daotion利益相关者的共识，整体经济模型将建立在SRM业务之上，包括但不限于发行人、持有者、验证者等核心参与方的利益分配与协调。我们将在未来不断推出代币经济学的细节设计，目前可以披露的计划是设计Free NFT来赋予发行人发行相关的供给，设计SBTs来赋予持有者持有相关的使用，并通过代币供给消耗模型来配置SBTs供给与需求之间的平衡，实现经济模型的正反馈。",
  "SRM protocol is the next generation of interactive CRM, which can centralize the interactive connection management of the relationship between the community and stakeholders and can better bring DAOs and stakeholders together. Only when DAOs and their stakeholders are deeply bound together to form a stable social relationship can they work together to move towards a decentralized society. The foundation of the social consensus layer is constantly strengthened to better support the data consensus layer and the computing extension layer to serve billions of people. Daotion hopes to build an SRM protocol to add bricks and tiles to the social consensus layer.": "SRM协议是下一代互动型的CRM，去中心化社区和利益相关者之间关系状态的互动连接管理，将能够把DAOs和利益相关者更好地聚集在一起，只有DAOs和他们的利益相关者深深地绑定在一起，形成稳固的社会关系，才能够共同携手走向去中心化社会。社会共识层基础的不断增强，才能更好地支撑数据共识层与计算扩展层服务数十亿人，Daotion希望通过建设SRM协议为社会共识层添砖加瓦。",
